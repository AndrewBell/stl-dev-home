I build software with two goals in mind; delight customers and enable fellow developers. I'm passionate about writing clean and collaborative code that both solves problems and matures as it grows. I strive for a DevOps mindset, using tools and automation to enable continuous delivery. Rapid and predictable releases enable the iterative process embodied in the principles of agile. Practicing human-centered design has reinforced the need to collaborate with users to understand their needs and iterate on their feedback.

I am passionate about building welcoming and inclusive communities of developers. I believe the best ideas come from a diversity of perspectives, and by creating supportive spaces for developers to grow and share their ideas we can build something greater than the sum of its parts.
